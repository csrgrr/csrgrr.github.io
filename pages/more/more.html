<h1>HI THERE!</h1>
<p>
  I am a Frontend Developer with experience and solid knowledge in web
  development. My focus is on creating efficient and scalable solutions. I have
  a high level of English, which allows me to communicate and collaborate
  fluently in multicultural environments and with international teams, with whom
  I already have extensive experience.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to my programming experience, I am a MA Egyptologist by the
  University of Liverpool. Although my previous academic background is focused
  on humanities, this unique perspective has provided me with the ability to
  approach problems creatively and think analytically in the field of
  programming.
</p>
<p>
  I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow professionally,
  staying updated on the latest technological trends and development
  methodologies. My passion for programming and my ability to quickly adapt to
  new environments make me a valuable collaborator in any team.
